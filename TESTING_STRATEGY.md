# Testing Strategy for PantryPal API

## Current Status
- **Complex test suite removed** to focus on AWS deployment
- Will build testing incrementally after deployment is working
- Focus on practical, maintainable tests that add real value

## Future Testing Strategy

### 1. **Simple Health/Smoke Tests** (Priority 1)
```bash
# Basic API health checks
curl -f https://api-endpoint/
curl -f https://api-endpoint/openapi.json

# Core endpoint availability (no auth needed)
curl -i https://api-endpoint/pantry/items  # Should return 401, not 500
curl -i https://api-endpoint/cookbook       # Should return 401, not 500
```

### 2. **Integration Tests with Real API** (Priority 2)
Test against deployed staging environment:
- User registration/login flow
- Pantry item CRUD operations  
- Recipe import/export
- Barcode scanning functionality
- AI/OpenAI integrations

### 3. **Contract Testing** (Priority 3)
- API schema validation
- Response format consistency
- Required field validation
- Error response structure

### 4. **Load/Performance Testing** (Priority 4)
```bash
# Simple load testing with curl
for i in {1..50}; do curl https://api-endpoint/ & done
wait

# Or with Apache Bench
ab -n 1000 -c 10 https://api-endpoint/
```

## Tools to Consider
- **pytest**: For Python unit tests (when needed)
- **requests**: For API integration tests
- **newman**: For Postman collection tests
- **curl**: For simple health checks
- **Apache Bench (ab)**: For load testing

## Test Categories by Value

### ✅ **High Value Tests**
- API health checks (does it respond?)
- Authentication flow (can users log in?)
- Core business logic (can users manage pantry?)
- Data persistence (does data save correctly?)

### ⚠️ **Medium Value Tests** 
- Error handling edge cases
- Input validation
- Performance under load
- External API integrations

### ❌ **Low Value Tests (Avoid for Now)**
- Complex mocking of AWS services
- Testing framework edge cases
- Over-testing simple CRUD operations
- Testing third-party library internals

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Health Monitoring
1. Add simple health check endpoint to API
2. Create basic curl-based smoke tests
3. Run these in CI after deployment

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Testing  
1. Create staging environment
2. Build integration tests for key user journeys
3. Test against real deployed API

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing
1. Add performance testing
2. Contract testing for API consumers
3. More comprehensive error scenarios

## Key Principles
- **Test behavior, not implementation**
- **Focus on user journeys** over individual functions
- **Test against real environments** when possible
- **Keep tests simple and maintainable**
- **Add tests incrementally** as value is proven
